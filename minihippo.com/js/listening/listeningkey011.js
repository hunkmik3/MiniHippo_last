I usually play motivational songs to help keep me alert, especially when studying in the morning. Music is like a cup of coffee, keeping me awake and motivated in my studies.\"\n\nD: \"I often can't focus on studying during the day; I feel tired and sleepy when I have to wake up early and study.

  topic: "Topic: Local festivals",
  transcript: "Man: Have you heard about the new local center opening next week? I think it will be a great place for exhibitions. But you know, I believe exhibitions should be different. They need to show new ideas, not just the same old things.\n\nWoman: I agree that exhibitions should be interesting, but I'm not sure they need to be completely different. Sometimes, it's nice to celebrate our traditions, even if they are losing significance.\n\nMan: Yes, that's true. But if we keep doing the same things, we might forget why those traditions are important. The more we change things, the more people will remember them!\n\nWoman: I see your point. However, I worry that the local festivals will disappear soon. If people don't care about them, they might stop celebrating altogether.\n\nMan: That's a good point, but I think we can make the festivals more exciting to attract people. We should include activities that everyone can enjoy, not just the same old customs.\n\nWoman: I understand that. But let's not forget how important schools are in keeping our traditions alive. They teach children about our culture and values. If schools don't focus on traditions, who will?\n\nMan: That's true! Schools play a big role. But maybe parents should be the ones in charge of this. Keeping traditions is everyone's responsibility, not just schools or the education system."
