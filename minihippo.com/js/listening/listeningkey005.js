Whenever I want to relax or enjoy the scenery, I ride my horse along the farm and across the meadows.\"\n\nB: \"My husband and I often wake up early and go to a nearby forest for exercise. We usually go jogging in the early morning to stay healthy, and we really enjoy the fresh air and natural scenery in the forest.\"\n\nC: \"I used to love mountain biking, enjoying the thrill of riding down steep slopes. It was really an amazing and adventurous feeling. However, after an injury from a fall, I became haunted by the fear of crashing and now I'm scared of this sport. But I still love the mountains, so I’ve decided to just go hiking every weekend instead.\"\n\nD: \"My father often encourages me to ride horses because it’s a sport he enjoys. But I’m very afraid of this animal and never want to learn how to ride, even though there’s a riding school near my house. Instead, I prefer mountain biking with my friends to conquer high peaks.\""

  topic: "Topic: The Internet (câu này cứ chọn BWBB - Bố Win bừa bộn)",
  transcript: "W: These days, there's so much information on the internet that I feel overwhelmed.\n\nM: That's true. A lot of people feel the same way, especially with the mix of real and fake information. Sometimes we end up reading fake news.\n\nW: That's why using the internet requires both knowledge and skills. Without good information-searching skills, we can waste a lot of time. There’s so much content uploaded to the internet every day, and we have to be cautious because it might not be accurate. As a result, people are gradually changing how they perceive the information they encounter online. It’s not like in the past when we read newspapers and believed everything was true.\n\nM: Additionally, the internet has made people much more impatient than before. They want everything to yield quick results. People are losing the ability to wait for outcomes like they used to.\n\nW: Exactly, because the internet allows us to find millions of results in less than a second. We're getting used to that, which is leading to a decline in patience and tolerance."
