The father in a red shirt is driving. Sitting next to him is the mother, she is smiling happily. Their children are sitting in the back seat. I think they are going to take a trip to somewhere far away from their home during holidays or weekends.

            "question3": "How can people overcome the time of a long journey?",
            "question3_answer": "There are so many ways to help people pass the time on a long journey and create more memorable travel experiences. I think the most common one is that we can listen to our favorite music or read a book to kill time. If you don’t have the concentration to read books, then you should watch a film or TV series instead. Playing a fun game is also one of the best ways to make the time pass faster. In addition, carrying some snacks is also extremely popular, in case they feel hungry."

            "question1_answer": "In this picture, I see a right hand holding a black remote facing the TV screen with many channels on the screen. There are many different channels on the screen such as music, sports, boxing, animation... I guess he/she is clicking and choosing the show he/she wants to watch. I can't guess if it's a woman or a man choosing a channel because I can only see the hand with the TV remote. Maybe he or she is in the living room because there is a white table and the desk shelf under the TV. It seems to be a smart TV because there are play, pause, stop, next, previous.",
            "question2": "How often do you watch films or programmers at home? Why?",
            "question2_answer": "Well, I’m keen on watching TV because it is one of my favorite activities. I often watch films or programs at home in my spare time like the evening on the weekend with my family. We are into watching comedy TV programs or action movies because we want to enjoy the fun of family weekends. Sometimes I watch a football game with my father on the weekend. Watching movies not only helps me let my hair down after a hard-working day but also makes me happy and expands my horizons. I think watching TV is very interesting.",
            "question3": "Which is better for learning, watching video or reading? Why?",
            "question3_answer": "Personally, I prefer watching videos to reading books. The graphics in the videos attract me and help me understand better. Besides, watching videos is extremely suitable for introductions to difficult topics, especially something unfamiliar. Furthermore, watching a video takes me less time than reading a book with the same content. Moreover, learning through a video can make us feel more comfortable and relaxed than reading. It not only expands my horizons but also helps me let my hair down after a hard-working day. But if you combine these two methods you can learn the best."

            "question3": "Why is free time important?",

I can sit and read these books for hours without getting bored, it not only expands my horizons and improves my mental health but also helps me to let my hair down after a hard working day.",
            "question3": "Why is reading important for children?",
            "question3_answer": "I suppose that reading brings many benefits to children, especially for children’s thinking and perception. Reading allows them to develop a better imagination and get more life information. When you start reading aloud to your child, you are basically giving them background information about the world, which helps them make sense of what they see, hear and read. In addition, I think reading is also good for children’s health because it helps them limit their exposure to electronic devices."

            "question2": "When was the last time you visited a new place?",
            "question2_answer": "The last time I explored a new place was about a month ago. I visited a charming little town in the countryside. The main square was surrounded by quaint cafes and historic buildings, creating a picturesque setting. I spent the day wandering through cobblestone streets, discovering local shops, and indulging in regional cuisine. The highlight was stumbling upon a hidden garden with vibrant flowers and a peaceful atmosphere. It was a refreshing experience, and I enjoyed the blend of history, culture, and nature in that new locale. Exploring unfamiliar places always brings a sense of adventure and discovery.",
            "question3": "Why do people like to go to new places?",
            "question3_answer": "People are drawn to new places for various reasons. The desire for adventure and exploration motivates individuals to discover different cultures, landscapes, and cuisines. Traveling to unfamiliar destinations provides a break from routine, fostering personal growth and creating lasting memories. It satisfies the innate curiosity to learn and experience new things. Whether it's the thrill of discovery, relaxation in a novel environment, or the chance to broaden one's perspectives, the allure of new places lies in the diverse and enriching experiences they offer."

            "question1_answer": "In this photo, I see a man and a woman in an apartment or a living room, where there are many storage boxes surrounding them. The couple is doing the housework. The man in white T-shirt and blue jeans is sweeping the floor. He seems to be happy to do that. The woman is collecting some bottles of beer and putting them in a plastic bag. She looks so tired and uncomfortable.",
            "question2": "Describe the last time you did some physical work.",
            "question2_answer": "The last time I did physical work was about a month ago. It's Tet. Everyone has a custom of cleaning the house before the Tet festival and so does my family. I had to sweep and clean 2 floors and besides, my mother and I had to clean and rearrange the cupboard, bookshelves and 2 wardrobes. The last days of the year are always the busiest, when everything had to be completed and the house also needed decorating. Although those are very tiring and heavy tasks, I found that they helped to strengthen the bonds between family members because we could create many unforgettable times with each other.",
            "question3": "Do you think machines will do all our hard work in the future? Why?",
            "question3_answer": "In my opinion, I don't think that machines can replace humans. Although many labor-saving devices have proved to be very useful in helping us save time and effort when doing housework such as washing the dishes, doing the laundry or vacuuming, I still believe that only humans can do non-standardized tasks. Robots are good at repetitive tasks but lousy at dealing with varied and unique situations. Machines make human skills more important. So, rather than undermining humans, we are much better off thinking hard about how to up skill ourselves and learn how to work."

            "question2_answer": "The last time I spoke in public was when I had to make a presentation about the benefits of nature. It was a project which was held by my club with the aim of raising public awareness about the environment and the measures to protect our nature. At first I was extremely nervous and scared. However I made sure that I knew what I wanted to say and I became more confident. I felt happy that I overcame my fear.",
            "question3": "Why are people scared of public speaking?",
            "question3_answer": "There are many reasons why people become afraid when having to speak in public. First of all, public speaking is an art that requires lots of courage, confidence and will-power. Most people lack this skill because of its challenging type of nature. Besides, people are afraid of public speaking because the look of a lot of people may make them feel shy and unable to express their feelings and their thoughts."

            "question1_answer": "This picture feels so dreamy. A girl is chilling on a yacht, soaking in the view of the open sea. She’s probably feeling the cool breeze in her hair while watching the waves sparkle under the sun. The vibe is super calm, like she’s just enjoying a peaceful moment far away from all the noise. Behind her, the ocean stretches endlessly, blending into the horizon where the sky shows off some gorgeous colors. It’s the kind of scene that makes you wanna be there too.",

            "question2_answer": "Honestly, I haven’t “gone” to the sea myself since I’m just your AI buddy, but if I could, I’d totally hit the beach whenever life feels too crazy. I’d imagine standing barefoot in the sand, feeling the waves tickle my feet, and just zoning out to the sound of the ocean. It’d be the perfect way to recharge. Maybe someday you can share your beach adventures with me—sounds like fun!",
            "question3": "Why do some people dislike going to the sea?",
            "question3_answer": "Not everyone’s into the sea, and that’s okay. Some people hate dealing with sticky sand getting everywhere, or they just can’t handle the salty water stinging their skin. Then there’s the fear factor—deep water and the idea of sharks freak some folks out. And let’s not forget the sunburns—ouch! For others, the sea might feel too quiet or even boring. Everyone vibes differently, and while some love the ocean’s"

Maybe he’s a businessman, or perhaps he’s just someone who knows how to enjoy life luxuriously. He’s got this cool, composed vibe, with one hand casually resting on the railing as he gazes out at the open sea. The sunlight reflects off the water, creating a crisp and clean backdrop that makes him look even more refined. It’s like a scene straight out of a movie or a luxury lifestyle ad—total power vibes!",
            "question2": "Tell me about the last time you used public transport",
            "question2_answer": "The last time I used public transport was just a few days ago. I took the metro to meet a friend in the city. It was a pretty smooth ride, actually. The train was fairly crowded, but it was still faster than driving because I didn’t have to deal with traffic or finding parking. Plus, it was nice not having to worry about the stress of navigating through the city, so I just put on some music and relaxed. I actually enjoy using public transport when it’s easy and convenient!",
            "question3": "How can we increase the number of people using public transport?",
            "question3_answer": "To get more people using public transport, we could make it more convenient and reliable. This means better schedules, faster routes, and more frequent services. Also, making it cheaper or offering discounts might encourage people who usually drive to switch. Lastly, improving the overall experience—like cleaner buses, better seats, and free Wi-Fi—could make a big difference!"

            "question2": "Tell me about a time you laughed a lot.",
            "question2_answer": "One time I laughed so much was during a camping trip with some friends. We were sitting around the campfire, telling stories, and someone started doing impressions of famous celebrities, but in the most random situations. At one point, they did a dramatic reading of a cereal box as if it was Shakespeare, and we all lost it. We couldn't stop laughing for like 20 minutes, even though it was just so silly.",
            "question3": "Do you think people from different countries laugh at different things?",
            "question3_answer": "Yeah, I definitely think people from different countries laugh at different things. Humor is so tied to culture and language. For example, in some cultures, wordplay and puns are huge, while in others, physical comedy or sarcasm might be more appreciated. Plus, the way people view social norms and taboos can change what’s considered funny, so a joke that works in one place might totally miss the mark in another."

The kids are all focused, their hands covered in flour, laughing and enjoying the messy fun. The teacher looks patient and encouraging, showing them step-by-step how to work the dough. There’s a sense of teamwork, creativity, and learning in the air. The table is filled with baking tools—bowls, rolling pins, and maybe some sprinkles waiting to be added. It’s the kind of moment that’s both educational and heartwarming, full of joy and life lessons.",
            "question2": "How do people learn to cook in your culture",
            "question2_answer": "Most people learn cooking from family—parents or grandparents are the first teachers. They pass down traditional recipes, and it’s usually a mix of watching, helping out, and eventually doing it yourself. Some learn by trial and error, experimenting with food at home. Nowadays, cooking shows, YouTube tutorials, and food blogs are super popular ways to pick up new skills or explore different cuisines. Schools sometimes offer cooking classes, too. It’s a blend of tradition, curiosity, and adapting to modern resources.",
            "question3": "Why is it important for people to learn how to cook for themselves?",
            "question3_answer": "Knowing how to cook is such a key life skill. It helps you eat healthier, save money, and control what goes into your meals. Cooking gives you independence—you don’t have to rely on takeout or someone else to feed you. Plus, it’s creative and satisfying to make something with your own hands. It’s also great for connecting with others; cooking for family or friends can be a way to bond and show love. And let’s be real, being able to whip up a tasty meal feels pretty awesome!"

            "question2_answer": "Absolutely! Parents in my country put a lot of love and effort into raising their kids. They’re involved in their education, health, and hobbies, always wanting what’s best for them. It’s common for parents to sacrifice their own needs to provide better opportunities for their children. They’re also big on teaching life values, like respect and responsibility. And while every family is different, the idea of nurturing and protecting kids is a universal priority.",
            "question3": "Why do parents care about their children?",
            "question3_answer": "Parents care because their children are a part of them—there’s a natural instinct to protect, nurture, and help them grow. They want to see their kids happy, healthy, and successful in life. It’s also about love; there’s this deep emotional bond that makes parents want to give their kids the best they can. Beyond that, many parents see raising their children well as a way to contribute positively to the future. It’s rewarding for them to watch their kids thrive and become their own unique individuals."

There are private schools and public schools in my country. The schools are not far from the houses. Also, the schools check where the parents live. The parents should live near the school."
