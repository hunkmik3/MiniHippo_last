    question: "What is not original?",
    options: ["Furniture", "Home", "Bicycle"], 
    correctAnswer: "Furniture", 
    transcript: "Welcome! I’m so glad you are interested in this beautiful property. This house was built in the 1920s and has maintained much of its original charm. The hardwood floors you see here are completely original, and they’ve been carefully preserved over the years. The same goes for the architecture- those high ceilings and detailed mouldings are a testament to the craftsmanship of that era. However, the furniture you see isn’t original. It was replaced a few years ago to give the home a more modern, functional feel. But don’t worry, the updates blend well with the classic features, giving you the best of both words- historic charm with modern comfort."

    question: "What did she advice for people who lack motivation at work?",
    options: ["Attend a time management workshop", "Request a transfer", "Take on additional responsibilities"], 
    correctAnswer: "Request a transfer", 
    transcript: "Many people feel unhappy at work, and often, they think a higher salary or less work will fix it. But that’s not always the solution. Sometimes, the problem is the work environment. A change of place can help improve how we feel at work. However, looking for a new job can be stressful and take time. One option is to ask for a transfer to another branch within the same company. This can offer the same benefits as getting a new job, without the challenges of starting over somewhere new."
