    question: "What is not original?",
    options: ["Furniture", "Home", "Bicycle"], 
    correctAnswer: "Furniture", 
    transcript: "Welcome! I’m so glad you are interested in this beautiful property. This house was built in the 1920s and has maintained much of its original charm. The hardwood floors you see here are completely original, and they’ve been carefully preserved over the years. The same goes for the architecture- those high ceilings and detailed mouldings are a testament to the craftsmanship of that era. However, the furniture you see isn’t original. It was replaced a few years ago to give the home a more modern, functional feel. But don’t worry, the updates blend well with the classic features, giving you the best of both words- historic charm with modern comfort."

    question: "What did she advice for people who lack motivation at work?",
    options: ["Attend a time management workshop", "Request a transfer", "Take on additional responsibilities"], 
    correctAnswer: "Request a transfer", 
    transcript: "Many people feel unhappy at work, and often, they think a higher salary or less work will fix it. But that’s not always the solution. Sometimes, the problem is the work environment. A change of place can help improve how we feel at work. However, looking for a new job can be stressful and take time. One option is to ask for a transfer to another branch within the same company. This can offer the same benefits as getting a new job, without the challenges of starting over somewhere new."

That time works great for me, so I just wanted to double-check if it’s good for you too. Alright, looking forward to it. See you then!"

    transcript: "Person A: 'Hey, do you know where Sarah likes to go shopping?' \nPerson B: 'Oh, yeah! She usually goes to that new shopping mall that just opened. It's got a lot of cool stores.' \nPerson A: 'Really? I haven't been there yet. What's it like?' \nPerson B: 'It's amazing! It's really modern, and there’s a big variety of shops. She loves it because she can find pretty much anything she needs, from clothes to electronics.' \nPerson A: 'That sounds great. I should check it out sometime.' \nPerson B: 'Definitely!

  topic: "Topic: Protect the environment",                  
  options: [
    "Does not use commercial cleaning products",
    "Give away used items",
    "Buy environmentally friendly products",
    "Reuse containers for storing food",
    "Plant trees in the backyard",
    "Use solar panels for electricity"
  ],
  transcript: `Person A: I find the act of giving away old or secondhand items a bit hypocritical. Why do people give away their old things, only to go out and buy the same item but brand new? Not only does this fail to protect the environment, but it also causes double the harm. Personally, I have a way of protecting the environment by not releasing harmful chemicals into it. I do this by not purchasing chemical cleaning solutions. Instead, I make use of natural products like lemons to create my own floor-cleaning solutions.

Person B: I often don\'t have time to think about how to reuse my belongings or clothes, but I don\'t want to throw them away because that would be wasteful. So, I think a better way is to donate them to charity organizations or give them to others. Many people are in need of these things, and giving away my old items also makes me feel happier because I\'m helping others.

Person C: A good way to protect the environment is by not using plastic bags or by bringing reusable bags when going to the market, which helps reduce the disposal of plastic bags, a material that is difficult to decompose. However, I\'m a very busy person and rarely have time to prepare my own bags when going shopping, and I usually drive to buy groceries quickly instead of walking. I guess I can\'t protect the environment by not driving. But I have a principle of only buying eco-friendly products, so I think I’m still contributing in a small way to protecting the Earth.

Person D: I see that too many people are wasting food containers, as they often throw them away after use, such as glass jars or plastic bottles. I can reuse them to store food and neatly organize them in my refrigerator. Reusing these containers is a very easy way to protect the environment that anyone can do.`

  topic: "Topic: Changes in the workplace",
  transcript: `W: I'm thinking about switching to another job.

M: Why? Your current job is very stable.

W: I think I should try my hand at different fields. The jobs I take should only last around 1-2 years. I don't like staying too long in one job or with one company; that would be really boring. Nowadays, many companies offer temporary jobs, which allows me to try out different fields.

M: Oh, but if you stay longer at one company, they might offer you more opportunities for career advancement. I always want to stay long-term with a company that suits me.

W: Nowadays, young people who have just graduated from university are very talented and have many qualifications. I'm afraid that if I stick with one job and don't change to accumulate knowledge in various fields, it will be hard to compete with these young, talented people.

M: We also need to consider job satisfaction. If we do well, we need to be encouraged and motivated. That helps employees feel that their efforts and contributions to the company are worthwhile.

W: You're absolutely right, I couldn't agree more. In this age of technological advancement, many jobs have been replaced by machines. More and more people are losing their jobs due to the development of technology and engineering. I think this is a concerning issue.

M: I don't think so. Technology is helping us do our work more quickly, easily, and conveniently than ever. If we know how to leverage technology in our jobs, productivity will increase significantly, which in turn helps develop the economy and society.`,
