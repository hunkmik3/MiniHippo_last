  transcript: "A: \"I personally don't like and don't have a talent for fine arts, especially painting. But I see it as a great way to engage in social charity activities. I'm passionate about teaching children how to draw because I love kids. I'm also part of a volunteer organization that specializes in teaching art to poor children, which makes me very happy.\"\n\nB: \"I think drawing with my children is a great way to understand them better. No matter how busy my work is, I always make time to sit and draw with my kids. This helps us bond more and gives me the chance to talk with them more.\"\n\nC: \"I've loved literature, art, and drawing since I was a child. Now, I'm a writer and a comic book creator. In my stories, I occasionally include some illustrations to make the book more vivid and lively.\"\n\nD: \"I'm currently taking a drawing course and I really want to be serious about it. When practicing drawing, I prefer not to draw with friends, even though they often invite me to join them. I want to focus entirely on my work.\""

  topic: "Topic: The politics",
  transcript: "M: Have you heard about the upcoming presidential election? A lot of young people have already voted, which shows that they're becoming more interested in politics.\n\nW: Yes, it's very different from our time. When I was 18, I never paid attention to politics.\n\nM: The technology era now gives us so many ways to engage with politics. Politicians often post their political activities on social media much more than they did in the past.\n\nW: Actually, politicians still carry out traditional political activities too. They still hand out flyers and participate in volunteer work.\n\nM: The development of information technology also overwhelms us with information. There’s so much news online that we don't know what to read. This makes keeping up with political news much more challenging than before.\n\nW: I think that as technology advances, it becomes easier for us to stay updated on the news. Technology allows us to use advanced filters to easily sort out the news we need to know.\n\nM: There are also more women involved in politics now than before. It seems society has become more open to women.\n\nW: Exactly. Women have the same education and learning abilities as men. They even lead in many areas of life. In the future, more and more women will be participating in political activities."
