    "<strong>Here is the perspective of four people on the above topic. Please read the content and answer the question.</strong>",
    "<strong>A:</strong> In the past, I really liked playing board games. Now, to limit the children from using computers, I often spend time playing with them. However, I have struggled with them because the games nowadays have more characters and rules, making us think a lot every time we play. Despite this, my children and I still like it and have a good time together.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> When I was a child, I often played soccer with other children of the same age. We usually played in the schoolyard and sometimes in the open spaces of the neighborhood. We divided into small teams and chased the ball until we were all tired.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> When I was a child, I didn't like going out to play, so I chose reading books as a form of entertainment. The stories described in the pages of books helped me discover my own world. Later, when I grew up, I started liking modern games with eye-catching interfaces, which help me relax and increase my creativity.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> When I was a child, I really liked outdoor activities. I remember that on bad weather days, I was always by the window, glued to it, looking outside and praying for the rain to stop. At those times, my mother often gave me paper and a box of crayons. I really enjoyed that drawing activity and often drew at home when the weather was bad.",

    "<strong>A:</strong> Before diving into any extreme sport, I truly believe it’s crucial to undergo proper training. While these activities can be thrilling, they also carry risks if you're not well-prepared. I've witnessed people injuring themselves simply because they didn't take the necessary precautions. That’s why I always make sure to complete a training program and familiarize myself with the safety guidelines before trying something new. With the right preparation, extreme sports can be an amazing experience.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> I've always had a fondness for more traditional sports such as swimming, running, and tennis. They're enjoyable and easy to incorporate into a routine. However, a few months ago, I had the chance to go bungee jumping during a vacation, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. I didn’t anticipate having so much fun! While I still prefer regular sports for daily exercise, I now feel much more open to trying extreme sports occasionally for the thrill.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> What I appreciate most about extreme sports is the unique way they allow me to connect with nature. Activities like rock climbing and mountain biking enable me to explore stunning landscapes while also pushing my physical and mental limits. It’s an escape from the everyday routine, and it makes me feel truly alive. If I had more time and resources, I would love to engage in these sports more frequently, particularly in wild, remote locations.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> I understand that some people find extreme sports exhilarating, but they’ve never been significant to me. In fact, I try to avoid them whenever I can. I’m not fond of the idea of placing myself in risky situations just for the sake of excitement. There are many safer alternatives to staying active and enjoying life. I’d much rather take a peaceful walk or do some yoga than jump out of an airplane or scale a mountain. It’s simply not my cup of tea.",

    "<strong>A:</strong> I stayed until the very last moment of the festival and absolutely loved the grand finale. The stage lit up with dazzling lights and fireworks, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. Although getting there was a hassle due to heavy traffic and packed buses, once I arrived, all those inconveniences faded away. In the end, the final performance made every bit of the struggle worthwhile.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> Normally, I steer clear of festivals, but I decided to give this one a try. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a great time. The sound quality was poor, the event schedule seemed chaotic, and to top it off, it started raining heavily. The muddy ground made things even worse, and I spent most of the day feeling uncomfortable. Honestly, I didn’t think it was worth the trouble. The only highlight for me was the beautiful park where the festival took place.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> I really enjoyed the lively atmosphere created by the music. One of the bands on the opening night was so amazing that I couldn’t help but sing along. However, everything was quite expensive. The tickets were pricey, and the food and drinks were ridiculously overcharged. I ended up spending more than I had planned. Even though the performances were great, I do hope the organizers will bring the prices down next year.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> For me, the most memorable part of the festival was its location. The park by the river was vast and picturesque, with plenty of spots to sit and unwind between performances. I enjoyed a nice lunch there, though it was a bit pricey. Some of the shows were enjoyable, but I didn’t stay for the entire event. Overall, it was the venue that left the biggest impression on me.",

Today, I collaborate on tech projects with my cousins using drag-and-drop coding platforms. These tools make the development process easier, but I always take the time to thoroughly test our creations. It’s a wonderful way to foster creativity and work together.",

    "<strong>A:</strong> When I was a child, I enjoyed playing board games with my parents after their busy workdays. Now, I get to share that experience with my own kids, and having a four-day workweek gives us more time together. Flexible schedules are a big help, but I always make sure to plan ahead so I can balance both work and family life. These are the moments that create lasting memories.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> As a kid, I would set up pretend offices with my friends, using toy phones and notebooks. I loved taking on the role of 'boss' and organizing our tasks. Those imaginative games taught me valuable lessons in organization and leadership, and I still laugh thinking about the 'serious' meetings we held.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> When I was younger, I devoured books about different professions, dreaming about what my future career might be. Those books inspired my ambition. Today, I rely on productivity apps to keep track of my tasks in my four-day workweek. While the apps make my work more efficient, the excitement of organizing and planning is still the same.",

    "<strong>A:</strong> When I was a child, I loved sitting by the fireplace listening to my grandfather’s folktales. His voice brought every character to life, and those evenings always felt magical—they taught me the power of imagination. Nowadays, I share that same joy with my nieces by reading interactive storybooks on tablets. The animations and sounds make the stories more vivid and exciting for them. Still, I always take care to choose content that’s suitable for their age. To me, blending old traditions with modern technology is a beautiful way to keep storytelling alive across generations.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> When I was a young, I used to ride my bike around the village with my friends almost every afternoon. I can still recall the feeling of the wind brushing against my face, the excitement of racing each other, and the pure sense of freedom it brought. Those simple rides weren’t just fun—they taught me what independence and adventure felt like, lessons that stayed with me as I grew up. Nowadays, it’s a bit sad to see that many children spend more time indoors, glued to screens instead of exploring outside. Sometimes I find myself missing those carefree afternoons when happiness was as simple as pedaling down a dusty road. Thinking back, I realize those moments helped me develop a love for the outdoors and a lasting appreciation for friendship.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> As a kid, I could spend hours drawing animals, trees, and landscapes with my box of crayons and pencils. I loved playing with bright colors and shapes, and I always felt proud showing my drawings to my family. What started as a simple childhood hobby slowly turned into a lifelong passion. Now, I’m a graphic designer, creating digital art for various clients. Modern design tools help me bring my ideas to life with more precision, yet the creative joy I feel is just like it was back then. For me, drawing has always been a way to express myself—and it still fills my days with happiness.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> When I was growing up, I loved going on camping trips with my family in the countryside. We pitched our tents, cooked simple meals over a fire, and spent long nights gazing at the stars. Those moments made me feel deeply connected to nature and left me with unforgettable memories. Sometimes, though, rainy weather would ruin our plans, and I always felt a bit sad when we had to stay indoors. These days, my adventures have taken a different form — I enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions instead. Exploring history through artifacts and stories gives me a similar sense of curiosity and wonder, just in a quieter, more comfortable setting. To me, museums are a gentle way to travel through time and appreciate the beauty of the past.",

Still, the stage was bright with lights and fireworks, and the overall atmosphere was unforgettable. The music lifted my mood and made me feel truly happy. Interestingly, by the final day, everything seemed different—I began to enjoy it a lot more. In the end, I was really glad I decided to go.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> I’ve been to this festival every year, and of course, I joined again this time. But honestly, I didn’t enjoy the music, and the weather made things worse. It kept raining, turning the ground muddy and uncomfortable for everyone. After this experience, I think I won’t go again next year.",

Even though I only played a few songs, I stayed until the event ended. The pay wasn’t great, but I really enjoyed myself because I got to reconnect with friends. However, I’m still thinking about the long travel distance since the venue was quite far from the city center."

    "<strong>Here are four people's opinions about extreme sports. Read carefully and answer the questions below.</strong>",
    "<strong>A:</strong> For me, the most important thing about extreme sports is being well-prepared. Many people think it’s all about excitement and courage, but I don’t see it that way. Without proper training, it’s easy to get hurt or even put others at risk. I once took a rock-climbing course and spent weeks learning how to use the equipment correctly. After that, the actual climb was much more enjoyable because I felt confident. I believe training not only keeps you safe but also makes the experience more relaxed and rewarding.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> I’ve always preferred traditional sports like swimming and running because they help me stay healthy without being too risky. Still, I was curious about how extreme sports might feel, so I tried bungee jumping during a holiday last year. At first, I was really nervous, but once I jumped, the feeling was incredible. It was a kind of thrill I had never felt before. Even so, I still swim every week because it’s safer and more practical, though I admit extreme sports can be exciting to try at least once.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> Honestly, I don’t really understand why people enjoy extreme sports. They seem dangerous and unnecessary to me. I’ve never tried one, and I don’t intend to. Some friends have invited me to go snowboarding or paragliding, but I always refuse. It’s not that I dislike sports—I actually enjoy cycling and tennis—but I just don’t see any reason to risk my health for a few seconds of excitement. In my opinion, extreme sports aren’t essential for happiness, so I stay away from them whenever I can.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> What I love most about extreme sports is that they often take place in beautiful natural settings. Last summer, I went kayaking on a wild river, and the scenery was breathtaking. I also tried mountain biking through the forest and loved the feeling of fresh air and freedom. For me, it’s not just about the sport itself but also about being surrounded by mountains, trees, and rivers. I sometimes wish I had more time and money to do these activities more often. Extreme sports give me energy and make me feel close to nature."

    "<strong>A:</strong> When I was a teenager, I loved recording short stories on an old tape recorder with my cousins. We spent hours coming up with ideas and acting them out just for fun. These days, we make podcasts using modern apps that make editing and publishing much easier and more enjoyable. Even though technology has simplified the process, we still spend a lot of time planning each episode carefully. For me, podcasting is a creative way to express ideas and connect with people on a deeper level.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> As a child, I spent many sunny afternoons flying kites in the park with my brothers and sisters. Watching my kite rise high into the sky always filled me with happiness and excitement. Those simple yet meaningful moments taught me patience and coordination. Even now, whenever I see children flying kites, I feel warm memories returning. Those carefree days will always be some of my favorite childhood moments.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> When I was little, I was fascinated by doing jigsaw puzzles with my family. Carefully fitting each piece into place was both fun and satisfying. Now that I’m older, I often play strategy-based video games, which feel like a modern version of puzzles. They’re not only entertaining but also help me stay focused and think critically. For me, these games bring the same sense of challenge and accomplishment that puzzles once did — just in a more dynamic and interactive way.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> I grew up near a beautiful lake, and swimming there with my friends was one of my favorite things to do. It was such a great way to spend time outdoors, though rainy days sometimes left me feeling bored at home. Nowadays, I practice yoga to relax and recharge after long working hours. It has helped me stay calm, balanced, and focused. Yoga has become an important part of my routine and a great way to take care of both my body and mind."

    "<strong>Here are four people's experiences about choosing or starting their careers. Read carefully and answer the questions below.</strong>",
    "<strong>A:</strong> When I first graduated from school, I wasn’t sure what to do, so I joined several volunteer programs with different companies and organizations to gain experience. I really enjoyed volunteering because it helped me decide on a career path and gave me many valuable lessons. I also believe I was able to make a difference through my work.",
    "<strong>B:</strong> Back in school, I already knew I wanted to become a teacher, so I didn’t need to try other jobs. I decided to study education at university, which is free in my country. Last summer, I did some practical training in local schools, and it was extremely helpful for my future career.",
    "<strong>C:</strong> When I was young, I used to help my neighbor, a plumber, with simple jobs like measuring pipes, loosening screws, and handling tools. It felt very natural for me to learn that kind of work, so later I studied for two years at university to become an electrician. Now, I’ve learned that there are shorter courses available in this field, and I regret not choosing that option instead.",
    "<strong>D:</strong> After graduating, I found it really difficult to get a job. I applied to many companies, but none accepted me because I lacked experience. Eventually, I found work at a gaming company that allowed me to work from home. It didn’t affect my daily schedule — I worked at night while my colleagues worked during the day — and that arrangement suited me perfectly."
